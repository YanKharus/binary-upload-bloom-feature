make posts be able to be commented on will probably be simplish as well 

I think it will have to sorted as its own collection linked to the post by the _id of post and by user
it will display who made the comment and maybe the date, TBD 

need to create a POST request in each post that will send the request through router then to controller as well as modify 
the post.ejs page to handle displaying comments and all the formatting 

also how will comments be fetched am I going to create a new route file that whose fetches are linked directly to post.ejs GET?

maybe I dont actually need to do that much, all I have to do is get an array of comments at the server side of GETTING a post 
and just send that information along with the render command 
so fetching them is easy I just need to reformat posts to be able to create them 

what information is needed to be passed around, probably the post _id
